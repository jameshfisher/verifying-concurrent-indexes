\begin{abstract}
The \emph{index}\xspace is a fundamental abstract data type.
A large number of algorithms exist that implement it,
  varying greatly in approach and complexity.
As multicore computing becomes standard,
  indexes allowing concurrent access are called for.
A number of concurrent index algorithms exist.
Their approaches build on the sequential algorithms,
  but their complexity significantly exceeds them,
  and their semantics are less clear.

The importance, complexity and ambiguity of concurrent indexing algorithms
  make them candidates for formal verification.
One success here is da Rocha Pinto \textit{et al.}'s verification\cite{hiding}
  of Sagiv's B-Link tree\cite{sagiv} (a well-known concurrent index algorithm).
The reasoning here uses separation logic\cite{Reynolds}
  and concurrent abstract predicates\cite{cap},
  which provide the tools to 
  specify the behaviour of concurrent indexes
  and to reason about algorithms implementing this.

This project applies the same tools
  to concurrent index algorithms building on the \RBt.
