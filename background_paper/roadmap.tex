\item[Implement sequential and concurrent \RBt]
One realization arising from this paper is
  the significant difference between implementations,
  and that each may have different implications for how readily analyzable it is.
A first step for me, then,
  is to produce a canonical implementation
    of the sequential \RBt and of the concurrent \RBt.

\item[Apply separation logic and \CAP to simple algorithms]
I have notes on applying simple separation logic
  (beyond the scope of this paper).
\CAP has considerable complexities I need to master
  before applying it to anything more than trivial.
In this regard,
  work in conjunction with Thomas Dinsdale-Young will be crucial.

\item[Apply separation logic to a sequential \RBt]
I have sketches of how this should be applied
  in the case of \IC{search} and \IC{insert}.
These need to be made more rigorous.

\item[Apply \CAP to concurrent \RBt]
This is the ultimate aim of this project
  and constitutes its original contribution.
