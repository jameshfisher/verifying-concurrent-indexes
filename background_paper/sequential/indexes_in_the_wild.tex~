\subsection{Indexes in the wild}

Performance of the many index algorithms is well-covered.
However, not all are commonly in use.
A survey of what's-used-where
  should shed light on
  what characteristics are considered most important.

\begin{description}

\item[C++ Standard Template Library]
This (at least in the GNU implementation)
  uses Red-Black trees for \IC{std::set} and \IC{std::map}.

\item[Java standard library]
\IC{TreeMap} uses a Red-Black tree.

\item[.NET standard library]
This uses a Red-Black tree for its \IC{SortedDictionary} class.

\item[Linux kernel]
This uses Red-Black trees for I/O scheduling and for virtual memory.
It uses a pseudo-templating style in C, so there's only one implementation: \IC{lib/rbtree.c}.

\item[ext3 filesystem]
This uses a Red-Black tree for directory entries.

\item[Ruby 1.9]
This uses a simple hashing algorithm for its index.
Apparently it is going to use an RB tree \ldots ?
