\subsubsection{Variations on Red-Black trees}


But there are variations
  on even the standard sequential Red-Black tree:

\begin{description}

\item[AA tree]
A simplification of the Red-Black tree.
It has the additional requirement that
  red nodes must be right children.
In the B-tree analogy, they are 2-3 trees.
Reduces seven cases to two.

\item[Left-Leaning Red-Black tree]  
Introduced by Sedgewick.
In a similar spirit to AA,
  this reduces the number of cases,
  by enforcing that
  no node may have a black left child and a red right child.
This means that, in the B-tree analogy,
  a 3-node only has a single representation in the RB tree.
Unlike the AA, this is still analogous to a 2-3-4 tree.
Main advantage is code simplicity:
  \IC{insert()} takes 33 lines vs 150 lines.

\end{description}
