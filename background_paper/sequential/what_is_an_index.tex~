\subsection{What is an index?}

An index\footnote{The same data type also goes by the names \emph{map}, \emph{dictionary}, \emph{associative array}, \emph{table}, and \emph{hash}.} stores values,
  where each value has a distinct name.
Many data sets fit this description.
For example,
  your mobile's contact list stores \emph{phone numbers},
  and each number is accessed with a person's \emph{name}.
At a larger scale,
  the Web can be seen as a store of \emph{pages},
  where each page has a \emph{URL}.
Even a language can be seen as an index:
  a store of \emph{concepts},
  where each concept can be accessed by a \emph{word}.
More fundamentally,
  any function stores elements from a \emph{range},
  where each element is accessed by a unique number from a \emph{domain}.
