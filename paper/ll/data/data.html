  <e:h>The <m:ll/> data structure</e:h>

  <p>
    The linked list (<m:ll/>) is the simplest set data structure
    that will submit to fairly efficient insertion, deletion and search
    of elements from a general ordered universe.
    It is a good place to start to set out the principles of verification
    that we can then aplly to more complex algorithms.
  </p>

  <p>
    A <m:ll/> representing set <e:st n="S"/> consists of a set of <e:size><e:st n="S"/></e:size> records,
    called <e:jargon>nodes</e:jargon>, in memory.
    There is a one-to-one correspondence between elements of <e:st n="S"/>
    and the set of <code>Node</code>s in the <m:ll/> representing <e:st n="S"/>.
    Each node contains two fields, <code>value</code> and <code>tail</code>.
    This can be written in a few lines:

    <e:listing>
      <e:caption>The <code>Node</code> data structure.</e:caption>
      <e:contents><xi:include href="../../../code/d/html/ll/node.d.html"/></e:contents>
    </e:listing>
  </p>

  <p>
    The fields <code>value</code> and <code>tail</code> have fixed length,
    respectively <e:var n="v"/> and <e:var n="t"/>.
    An instance of the <code>Node</code> record thus has a fixed length in memory
    <e:eq>
      <e:var n="l"/>
      <e:plus>
	<e:var n="v"/>
	<e:var n="t"/>
      </e:plus>
    </e:eq>.
    Therefore any node beginning at some address <e:var n="a"/> spans the contiguous addresses
    <e:var n="a"/>…<e:plus><e:var n="a"/><e:var n="l"/></e:plus>.
    The addresses occupied by the <code>Node</code>s are <e:jargon>disjoint</e:jargon>;
    <m:ie/>, for any <code>Node</code>, its occupied addresses
    are occupied no other <code>Node</code>.
    We say that a record beginning at address <e:var n="a"/> is <q>at <e:var n="a"/></q>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As there is a one-to-one correspondence between elements of <e:st n="S"/> and <code>Node</code>s,
    each <code>Node</code> contains as its <code>value</code> field one element of <e:st n="S"/>,
    and for each element of <e:st n="S"/>, there exists a <code>Node</code> containing it.
    The <code>tail</code> field of a record holds the address of another record in the data structure.
    Specifically, for a record <code>r</code> representing element <e:var n="s"/>,
    if there are elements in <e:st n="S"/> larger than <e:var n="s"/>,
    the <code>tail</code> field of <code>r</code> is set to
    the address of the <code>Node</code> representing the next-largest element;
    otherwise, the <code>tail</code> field is set to <code>null</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The final necessary piece of information is 
    the address of the record representing the smallest element in <e:st n="S"/>,
    which we call <code>head</code>.
    This address and the set of memory locations occupied by the <code>Node</code>s comprise the <m:ll/> data structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can visualize the address space of memory as a line of cells,
    from address <e:const n="0"/> on the left-hand-side to <e:const n="address_max"/> on the right.
    Here is an example <m:ll/> representing the set
    <e:eq>
      <e:st n="S"/>
      <e:set>
	  <e:const n="2"/>,
	  <e:const n="29"/>,
	  <e:const n="30"/>,
	  <e:const n="77"/>
      </e:set>
    </e:eq> from the domain of natural numbers &lt; 256.
    There are <e:pow>216</e:pow> memory locations,
    spanning addresses <e:const n="0"/> to <e:const n="65,535"/>,
    so a memory address is two bytes long.
    Memory locations are one byte long.
    The domain of the set is representable by one byte,
    so the <code>value</code> field is one byte long;
    and the <code>tail</code> field, being an address, is two bytes long;
    an single record is thus three bytes in total.
    In the following diagram, arrows are used to highlight fields that reference other memory locations.

    <e:diagram>
      <e:caption>An example <m:ll/> representing the set
	<e:eq>
	  <e:st n="S"/>
	  <e:set>
	    <e:const n="2"/>,
	    <e:const n="29"/>,
	    <e:const n="30"/>,
	    <e:const n="77"/>
	  </e:set>
	</e:eq>.</e:caption>
      <e:contents><xi:include href="./example.svg" /></e:contents>
    </e:diagram>
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>Node</code>s are at arbitrary memory locations;
    the program does not have the ability to decide on the locations given to it.
    The addresses cannot really contribute to the data held by the data structure,
    and so the above diagram therefore contains a lot of visual <q>noise</q>.
    We can abstract the diagram to remove these addresses and untangle the arrows:


    <e:diagram>
      <e:caption>The previous example, untangled.</e:caption>
      <e:contents><xi:include href="./example_untangled.svg" /></e:contents>
    </e:diagram>
  </p>

  <p>
    It is now visually obvious why this is called a list:
    the structure can be seen as a connected, directed, acyclic graph,
    with a single path between the node distinguished as the first and that distinguished as the last,
    on which all nodes lie.
    The second thing this diagram makes visually obvious is that
    the linked list <q>contains</q> smaller linked lists within it.
    For example, the <code>tail</code> field of the <code>Node</code> representing the element <e:const n="2"/>
    is effectively the <code>head</code> address for a linked list containing the right-most three nodes.
    We can outline all the linked lists in the above diagram:

    <e:diagram>
      <e:caption>The previous example showing nested structure.</e:caption>
      <e:contents><xi:include href="./example_nested.svg"/></e:contents>
    </e:diagram>
  </p>

  <p>
    It is now obvious that the <m:ll/> is a <e:jargon>recursive data structure</e:jargon>:
    it contains smaller versions of the same structure.
    Abstracting from our example, we can show this recursion visually:

    <e:diagram>
      <e:caption>The previous example showing recursive structure.</e:caption>
      <e:contents><xi:include href="./recursive.svg" /></e:contents>
    </e:diagram>
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice in our example that though <e:eq><e:size><e:st n="S"/></e:size><e:const n="4"/></e:eq>,
    there are actually <em>five</em> linked lists:
    the final <code>null</code> pointer conceptually points to
    a linked list representing <m:empty/>, which uses no memory locations.
    This does not fit in the scheme of the above diagram,
    which really only applies to non-empty sets.
    The linked list, then, actually uses two distinct representations of sets:
    one for non-empty sets as above,
    and another for the empty set, signaled by the use of a <code>null</code> pointer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us refer to these representations as <e:predicate>NonEmptyList</e:predicate>
    and <e:predicate>EmptyList</e:predicate> respectively,
    which are both subtypes of the abstract type <e:predicate>List</e:predicate>.
    These are all <e:jargon>predicates</e:jargon>;
    meaning they wrap up a description of (part of) the state of the program,
    including the structure of memory.
    Each of the above predicates takes two parameters corresponding to the two necessary <q>parts</q> of a <m:ll/>:
    the <code>head</code> pointer into the structure, and the set that the structure represents.
    That is, <e:pred name="List"><code>head</code>, <e:st n="S"/></e:pred>
    describes a set of memory locations forming a linked list that represents set <e:st n="S"/>,
    with <code>head</code> being the address of the first <code>Node</code> in the list
    (or <code>null</code> if <e:eq><e:st n="S"/><m:empty/></e:eq>).

    <e:diagram>
      <e:caption>Our basic <m:ll/> predicates.</e:caption>
      <e:contents><xi:include href="./predicates.svg" /></e:contents>
    </e:diagram>
  </p>

  <p>
    We now have a strong visual intuition for how to describe the <m:ll/> formally.
    The above diagram translates cleanly into the notation of separation logic.
    Let's approach this top-down, and begin with the <e:predicate>List</e:predicate> predicate.
    The <m:ll/> defines two representations of sets,
    and the general <e:predicate>List</e:predicate> predicate simply means that
    one of the two representations is being used to represent the set.
    We can therefore define <e:predicate>List</e:predicate> just as a disjunction:

    <e:definition name="List">
      <e:pred name="List"><code>head</code>, <e:st n="S"/></e:pred> ≝
      <e:or>
	<e:pred name="EmptyList"><code>head</code>, <e:st n="S"/></e:pred>
	<e:pred name="NonEmptyList"><code>head</code>, <e:st n="S"/></e:pred>
      </e:or>.
    </e:definition>
  </p>

  <p>
    The empty set is represented by a <code>null</code> pointer and no allocated heap memory.
    Translating this to separation logic is also straightforward:

    <e:definition name="EmptyList">
      <table>
	<tbody>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      <e:pred name="EmptyList"><code>head</code>, <e:st n="S"/></e:pred> ≝
	    </td>
	    <td>
	      <e:eq>
		<code>head</code>
		<code>null</code>
	      </e:eq> ∧
	    </td>
	    <td></td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td></td>
	    <td>
	      <e:eq>
		<e:st n="S"/>
		<m:empty/>
	      </e:eq> ∧
	    </td>
	    <td><e:st n="S"/> is the empty set and</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td></td>
	    <td><m:hemp/>.</td>
	    <td>there is no allocated memory.</td>
	  </tr>
	</tbody>
      </table>
    </e:definition>
  </p>

  <p>
    The <e:predicate>NonEmptyList</e:predicate> is only a little more complex.
    First, we must express the relationship between
    the set <e:st n="S"/> represented by the list pointed to by <code>head</code>,
    the <e:var n="value"/> in the <code>Node</code>,
    and the set <e:st n="T"/> represented by the <e:var n="tail"/> pointer.
    First, <e:st n="S"/> is the element <e:var n="v"/> plus the elements in <e:st n="T"/>; we write
    <e:eq>
      <e:st n="S"/>
      <e:union>
	  <e:set><e:var n="value"/></e:set>
	  <e:st n="T"/>
      </e:union>
    </e:eq>.
    But <e:var n="value"/> is not just an arbitrarily chosen value from <e:st n="S"/>,
    it is the smallest element.
    Another way to say this is that all the elements in <e:st n="T"/> are all greater than <e:var n="v"/>;
    we write
    <e:forall>
      <e:vars>
	<e:in>
	  <e:var n="t"/>
	  <e:st n="T"/>
	</e:in>
      </e:vars>
      <e:expr>
	<e:lt>
	  <e:var n="value"/>
	  <e:var n="t"/>
        </e:lt>
      </e:expr>
    </e:forall>.

    We can express this relationship with a helper predicate, <e:predicate>ListCompose</e:predicate>,
    to be used by <e:predicate>NonEmptyList</e:predicate>.

    <e:definition name="ListCompose">
      <table>
	<tbody>
	  <tr>
	    <td><e:pred name="ListCompose"><e:var n="value"/>, <e:st n="T"/>, <e:st n="S"/></e:pred> ≝</td>
	    <td>
	      <e:eq>
		
		  <e:union>
		    <e:set><e:var n="value" /></e:set>
		    <e:st n="T"/>
		  </e:union>
		
		<e:st n="S"/>
	      </e:eq> ∧
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td></td>
	    <td>
	      <e:forall>
		<e:vars>
		  <e:in>
		    <e:var n="t"/>
		    <e:st n="T"/>
		  </e:in>
		</e:vars>
		<e:expr>
		  <e:lt>
		    <e:var n="value"/>
		    <e:var n="t"/>
		  </e:lt>
		</e:expr>
	      </e:forall>.
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	</tbody>
      </table>
    </e:definition>
  </p>

  <p>
    The predicate <e:pred name="NonEmptyList"><code>head</code>, <e:st n="S"/></e:pred>
    must first assert that <e:st n="S"/> is non-empty.
    One way of saying this is to assert that the exists some element—let's call it <e:var n="value"/>—in the set.
    We can then also assert that there exists some other set, <e:st n="T"/>,
    which together with <e:set><e:var n="value"/></e:set> forms <e:st n="S"/>.
    While we're at it, we can choose <e:var n="value"/> to be the minimal element,
    as we will shortly be concerned with this value when describing the first <code>Node</code> in the list.
    Now we can use our <e:predicate>ListCompose</e:predicate> predicate
    to describe <e:var n="value"/> and <e:st n="T"/> in relation to <e:st n="S"/>; we write
    <e:exists>
      <e:vars><e:var n="value"/>, <e:st n="T"/></e:vars>
      <e:expr><e:pred name="ListCompose"><e:var n="value"/>, <e:st n="T"/>, <e:st n="S"/></e:pred></e:expr>
    </e:exists>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We must now describe the memory layout for a non-empty list.
    Looking at our visual definition,
    notice that the memory locations can be divided into two disjoint sets:
    one set for the first <code>Node</code>, consisting of contiguous memory locations beginning at <code>head</code>,
    and another set of locations for the rest of the <code>Node</code>s,
    which can be described by the <e:predicate>List</e:predicate> predicate.
    We can decompose the memory description into
    a description of the first <code>Node</code> and a description of the rest of the list,
    specifying that these sets are disjoint.
    This is exactly what the separating conjunction, ∗, does.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first <code>Node</code> record begins at address <code>head</code>
    and consists of two fields, the first containing <e:var n="value"/>,
    and the second containing some (unknown) address <e:var n="tail"/>.
    We write this as 
    <e:fcell>
      <code>head</code>
      <e:list><e:var n="value" />, <e:var n="tail"/></e:list>
    </e:fcell>.
    Notice that the lengths of the fields is left unspecified and is in fact unimportant.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rest of the list represents <e:st n="T"/> and its head is at address <e:var n="tail"/>.
    We already have a predicate to describe this:
    <e:pred name="List"><e:var n="tail"/>, <e:st n="S"/></e:pred>.
    Notice that <e:predicate>List</e:predicate> and <e:predicate>NonEmptyList</e:predicate> are mutually recursive.
    We are now in a position to define <e:predicate>NonEmptyList</e:predicate>:

    <e:definition name="NonEmptyList">
      <table>
	<tr>
	  <td><e:pred name="NonEmptyList"><code>head</code>, <e:st n="S"/></e:pred> ≝</td>
	  <td>∃<e:var n="value"/>, <e:var n="tail"/>, <e:st n="T"/>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td></td>
	  <td><e:pred name="ListCompose"><e:var n="value"/>, <e:st n="T"/>, <e:st n="S"/></e:pred> ∧</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td></td>
	  <td><e:sep>
	      <e:fcell>
		  <code>head</code>
		  <e:list><e:var n="value" />, <e:var n="tail"/></e:list>
	      </e:fcell>
	      <e:pred name="List"><e:var n="tail"/>, <e:st n="T"/></e:pred>
	    </e:sep>.</td>
	</tr>
      </table>
    </e:definition>
  </p>
