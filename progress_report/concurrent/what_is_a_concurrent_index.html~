  <h3>What is a concurrent index?</h3>

  <p>
    The previous algorithms and data structures
    are designed for sequential access.
    Performing concurrent operations on them results in undefined behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    One naive implementation of a concurrent index
    might simply enforce that, at any one time,
    at most one operation from $\Set{\IC{search}, \IC{insert}, \IC{remove}}$ is running.
    A slightly better implementation
    might restrict to either any number of \IC{read}s,
    or one of $\Set{\IC{insert}, \IC{remove}}$.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is still too restrictive:
    looking at the various indexing algorithms,
    many of them should, with minimal modification, permit
    multiple concurrent \IC{insert} operations---the \BST, for example.
    With no knowledge of implementation,
    what restrictions should we expect from an index?
    We might make the observation that, conceptually,
    the keys in an index are independent.
    The fact that key \IC{k} is in the index or not,
    or that it has some value in the index,
    provides no information about key \IC{l}
    (where $\IC{k} â‰  \IC{l}$).
    Therefore, we might expect restrictions to be placed only individual keys,
    rather than on the entire index.
    For example, we might have the only restriction that,
    for any key \IC{k},
    at most one operation from $\Set{\IC{search(k)}, \IC{insert(k, \_)}, \IC{remove(k)}}$ is running.
