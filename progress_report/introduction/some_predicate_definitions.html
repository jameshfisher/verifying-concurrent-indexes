  <h3>Some predicate definitions</h3>

  <p>
    Earlier, in our index API specification,
    we introduced the predicate <e:pred name="Index"><code>i</code>, <e:const n="I" /></e:pred>.
    This simply says that <q><code>i</code> represents the index <e:const n="I"/></q>.
    This was deliberately <em>abstract</em>,
    so that individual index implementations could define it themselves.
    Now we've looked at a few index data structures,
    how can we formally describe them?
  </p>

  <p>
    Our main tool here is <e:jargon>separation logic</e:jargon>,
    an extension of <e:jargon>Hoare logic</e:jargon> with practical operators to describe the state of the heap.
    Here, I only specify the set versions of the data structures.
