  <h3>What is an index?</h3>

  An index<footnote>The same data type also goes by the names <em>map</em>, <em>dictionary</em>, <em>associative array</em>, <em>table</em>, and <em>hash</em>.</footnote> stores values,
  where each value has a distinct name.
  Many data sets fit this description.
  For example,
  your mobile's contact list stores <em>phone numbers</em>,
  and each number is accessed with a person's <em>name</em>.
  At a larger scale,
  the Web can be seen as a store of <em>pages</em>,
  where each page has a <em>URL</em>.
  Even a language can be seen as an index:
  a store of <em>concepts</em>,
  where each concept can be accessed by a <em>word</em>.
  More fundamentally,
  any function stores elements from a <em>range</em>,
  where each element is accessed by a unique number from a <em>domain</em>.
